# Neighborhood Map (React) Project

You can find some of my favorite place in App from my childhood.

## Needs

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* for development mode start the server with `npm start`, your browser will start automaticaly

The offline mode (service worker) is reachable only in Production mode.

* for production mode you need to run `npm run build`, navigate to `build` map and run your fav server
